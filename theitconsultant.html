                    <h3>My interest in technology</h3>
                        My journey into the programming world spans several decades, 
                        I had an interest in computers and technology and wanted a 
                        degree in computer science but due to circumstances beyond my 
                        control I ended up with a degree in Agricultural Economics. 
                        So I have spent a few decades in financial services as an auditor,
                         accountant and financial adviser in both Nigeria & the United Kingdom. 
                         I have worked with top organisations including Ernst & Young, Citibank, 
                         NatWest Bank, HMRC, NHS, Edward Jones, Lloyds Banking Group & Accenture. 
                         In that time I have identified a huge gap between what providers of financial 
                         services are “selling” and what consumers require. I came into coding as I was 
                         passionate about setting up an application that would help clients with financial 
                         education, without the need to buy any product, developing a positive money mindset
                          and providing a database of carefully selected providers that would support 
                          clients to achieve their goals.
