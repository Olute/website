                        <h3>About me</h3>  
                        Information Technology (IT) plays a vital role in business and is responsible for the revolution that has taken 
                        place in the business world such as the dotcom era. In the US for example there are thousands who run their entire 
                        businesses online and the small businesses who have no online presence plan to achieve this. According to the 
                        research firm Clutch.co 94% of small business website would be mobile friendly. The internet and IT has enabled 
                        businesses to reach more potential customers, develop an interactive relation with clients, reduce costs, maximise 
                        profit, improve customer relations & efficiency, empower staff to do more, reduce overheads, reassign costs and 
                        talents to core business areas.  

                        The impact of IT has been well documented in areas such as; marketing using digital transformation, data-driven, 
                        mobile-ready approach. In operations the use of productivity tools to manage time, cost, resources and the whole 
                        project as a whole; In manufacturing the use of artificial intelligence to create innovative and state of the art 
                        products is becoming more and more popular. The finance teams are working more closely with IT and marketing to 
                        provide useful data that integrates with the Customer Relationship Management (CRM) system and generates much needed 
                        that drives marketing as well as production.

                    <h3>My interest in technology</h3>
                        My journey into the programming world spans several decades, 
                        I had an interest in computers and technology and wanted a 
                        degree in computer science but due to circumstances beyond my 
                        control I ended up with a degree in Agricultural Economics. 
                        So I have spent a few decades in financial services as an auditor,
                         accountant and financial adviser in both Nigeria & the United Kingdom. 
                         I have worked with top organisations including Ernst & Young, Citibank, 
                         NatWest Bank, HMRC, NHS, Edward Jones, Lloyds Banking Group & Accenture. 
                         In that time I have identified a huge gap between what providers of financial 
                         services are “selling” and what consumers require. I came into coding as I was 
                         passionate about setting up an application that would help clients with financial 
                         education, without the need to buy any product, developing a positive money mindset
                          and providing a database of carefully selected providers that would support 
                          clients to achieve their goals.
