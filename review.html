the effectiveness of the tools, legal constraint and how to handle accesibility issues. In general terms the website has achieved what it was

<li>Is there a menu page that helps with navigation</li>
<li>Is there consistency in the look and feel of the website</li>

</ul>
Functional testing on the other hand tends to look at the technical aspects of the website to ensure there are no errors and the website
can be correctly displayed.
<ul>
<li>Test the outgoing links from all the pages</li>

<li>Test all internal links.</li>

<li>Finally, link checking includes, check for broken links in all above-mentioned links.</li>

<li>Check validation of fields.</li>

<li>Test to check if there are any orphan pages.</li>

<li>validate the site for HTML syntax errors.</li>
