                        <h3>About me</h3>  
                        Hi my name is Tola Ayeni, mum to a gorgeous teenager. I enjoy reading and singing and I’m a great believe in 
                        life-long learning. I have spent a few decades in financial services in roles including audit, advisory and 
                        compliance.  With a background in accounting and financial services, I have a strong analytical background 
                        and I have been fascinated by the world of computers and the trend in digital transformation has made it a 
                        necessity to retrain in order to be relevant. 

                        In this regard I have undertaken training in business analysis, understanding the impact of GDPR on IT projects. 
                        I have concluding a level 2 developer course in coding with a view to getting into an apprenticeship role as a 
                        junior developer.

                        <h3>My interest in technology</h3>
                            My journey into the programming world spans several decades, 
                            I had an interest in computers and technology and wanted a 
                            degree in computer science but due to circumstances beyond my 
                            control I ended up with a degree in Agricultural Economics. 
                            So I have spent a few decades in financial services as an auditor,
                             accountant and financial adviser in both Nigeria & the United Kingdom. 
                             I have worked with top organisations including Ernst & Young, Citibank, 
                             NatWest Bank, HMRC, NHS, Edward Jones, Lloyds Banking Group & Accenture. 
                             In that time I have identified a huge gap between what providers of financial 
                             services are “selling” and what consumers require. I came into coding as I was 
                             passionate about setting up an application that would help clients with financial 
                             education, without the need to buy any product, developing a positive money mindset
                              and providing a database of carefully selected providers that would support 
                              clients to achieve their goals.
