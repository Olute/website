                        <h3>Role of technology in business</h3>  
                        Information Technology (IT) plays a vital role in business and is responsible for the revolution that has taken 
                        place in the business world such as the dotcom era. In the US for example there are thousands who run their entire 
                        businesses online and the small businesses who have no online presence plan to achieve this. According to the 
                        research firm Clutch.co 94% of small business website would be mobile friendly. The internet and IT has enabled 
                        businesses to reach more potential customers, develop an interactive relation with clients, reduce costs, maximise 
                        profit, improve customer relations & efficiency, empower staff to do more, reduce overheads, reassign costs and 
                        talents to core business areas.  

                        The impact of IT has been well documented in areas such as; marketing using digital transformation, data-driven, 
                        mobile-ready approach. In operations the use of productivity tools to manage time, cost, resources and the whole 
                        project as a whole; In manufacturing the use of artificial intelligence to create innovative and state of the art 
                        products is becoming more and more popular. The finance teams are working more closely with IT and marketing to 
                        provide useful data that integrates with the Customer Relationship Management (CRM) system and generates much needed 
                        that drives marketing as well as production.

                        <h3>Skills and resources required</h3>  
                   In this age of digital transformation which emphasies the use of digital 
                   technologies to handle traditional processes, competencies and models in order to leverage the 
                   impact and effectiveness of digital innovation for effective deployment. There are specific skills required; a good 
                   IT consultant would need to have the following skills
                   <ul>
                   <li>Excellent communication & interpersonal skills</li>
                   <li>Ability to work well in a team</li>
                   <li>Ability to present to different stakeholders</li>
                   <li>A logical napproach to probloem solving</li>
                   <li>Great customer service skills</li>
                   <li>A business awareness would be beneficial as well</li>
                </ul>
                    There are host of tools and resources available to the IT consulatant and the deployment of this would depend on the 
                    individual company, what integrates best with their existing systems including finance & HR. As a consultant I have used 
                    the following tools
                    Jira - used for tracking issues and bugs on a project
                    Confluence - cololaborative tool used to share knowledge and capture requirements, assign tasks
                    Trello - is a Kanban style board that helps to track the progress of a project
                    Slack - is a collaborative tool that enables communication across teams

                        <h3>The place of planning in IT projects</h3> 
                    Planning is an essential step in the project lifecycle and needs to be carried out at the start of the project. This 
                    provides a roadmap and a framework for the project to be carried out. The planning stage sets out the objective, scope 
                    and activities within the phases as well as the budget and resources required to achieve the tasks. There are a lot of tools 
                    available for planning purposes both online and offline. I have had the opportunity to use the following, Con fluence, Jira, 
                    projectmanager.com, Basecamp, slack and Trello. For this project Ie have used Trello both as a planning tool and as a means of 
                    communication between teams. It is an effective tool as it allows tasks to be displayed in Kanban style and items can be grouped 
                    based on assigned labels and interdependencies identified.

                        <h3>Risks associated with digital project management</h3>

                        Digital projects fail for the following reasons 

                        A lack of proper planning to determine the pace of implementation 
                        
                        Lack of underst5anding what digital transformation means to the different arms of the business 
                        
                        Lack of stakeholder buy-in 
                        
                        Lack of focus 
                        
                        A resistance to change 
                        
                        Implementing a project simply because it worked somewhere else 
                        
                        Insufficient human resources with the required talent to implement the change 
                        
                        Empasis on new development rather than customer innovation  
                        
                        Inability to integrate all new projects to the overall vision of the firm 
                        
                        Alienating the digital IT team for the rest of the enterprise 
                        
                        Insufficient budget to complete the project 
                        
                        Lack of continuity 
                </div>

                    <h3> Selecting software and sytems for an IT project</h3>
                    
                    Before considering IT systems an organisation should establish its vision and what they would like to achieve from the digital transformation. This would determine the choice of systems and tools to deploy. In particular the areas to look at will include the following; 

System requirements 

The company goals 

How it integrates with existing system 

Providers and their ability to integrate into existing systems such as CRM 

Training required 

Their ability to keep up with future technology 

References from existing clients within the same industry 

The initial outlay viz a viz the Return On Investment (ROI) of implementing the new system

            <h3>Legal Constarints to be considered for an IT project</h3>

            With the use of IT in all major sectors including financial services, insurance, technology and especially social media. As a result of the amount of data and information been transmitted electronically there are laws and regulations to guide how data is used, processed and stored. The General Data Protection Regulation which came in to effect on 25th May 2018 has the following headlines to protect EU citizens; 

Requiring the consent of subjects for data processing 

Anonymizing collected data to protect privacy 

Providing data breach notifications 

Safely handling the transfer of data across borders 

Requiring certain companies to appoint a data protection officer to oversee GDPR compliance 

Simply put, the GDPR mandates a baseline set of standards for companies that handle EU citizens’ data to better safeguard the processing and movement of citizens’ personal data. 

In the UK the Information Commissioner office (ICO) is responsible to uphold information rights. Comp0anies have to register with the ICO to handle data and have to report breaches as when they occur. Non-compliance could result in fines and penalties. 

 

As a minimum organisation are required to seek consent for requesting, handling and storing personal information of data subjects

                    <h3>My interest in technology</h3>
                        My journey into the programming world spans several decades, 
                        I had an interest in computers and technology and wanted a 
                        degree in computer science but due to circumstances beyond my 
                        control I ended up with a degree in Agricultural Economics. 
                        So I have spent a few decades in financial services as an auditor,
                         accountant and financial adviser in both Nigeria & the United Kingdom. 
                         I have worked with top organisations including Ernst & Young, Citibank, 
                         NatWest Bank, HMRC, NHS, Edward Jones, Lloyds Banking Group & Accenture. 
                         In that time I have identified a huge gap between what providers of financial 
                         services are “selling” and what consumers require. I came into coding as I was 
                         passionate about setting up an application that would help clients with financial 
                         education, without the need to buy any product, developing a positive money mindset
                          and providing a database of carefully selected providers that would support 
                          clients to achieve their goals.
